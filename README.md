# Wind Hourly Generation Factors Simulations 
R code for different types of stochastic forecasts simulations models including decomposition, Monte Carlo simulation, bootstrap and ETS and ARIMA techiniques. The main goal is to find the best method to simulate hourly based wind capacity factors in mid/long-term energy planning studies.
