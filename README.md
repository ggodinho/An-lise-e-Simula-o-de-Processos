# Wind Hourly Generation Factors Simulation 
R code for different types of stochastic forecast simulation models including STL decomposition, Monte Carlo simulation, bootstrap, ETS and ARIMA techniques. The main goal is to find the best method to simulate hourly based wind capacity factors for Brazil's mid/long-term energy planning studies.
